... a Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar - expected to graduate in Fall '25 - with concentration in Security & Privacy.

In Spring '24, I took an NLP course which led to work on two shared tasks in Summer '24. The results were published at conferences. Currently, I'm working on Automated Essay Scoring for Arabic.

In parallel, I work with the Bioinformatics team at Sidra Medicine as a full-stack developer. I’m building a system that automates data extraction workflows and allows researchers to interact with both metadata and genomic files.

In Spring '25, I took a prompt engineering course and have since been exploring generative AI — from research prototypes to industry implementations.

Among other things, my intellectual curiosity includes: bio-inspired ML architectures, AI for formal verification & mechanistic interpretability for LLMs.

In my downtime, I tinker with typography.
