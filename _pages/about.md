... a Computer Science major at [Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/) - expected to graduate in Fall '25 - with concentration in [Security & Privacy](https://s3d.cmu.edu/education/undergrad-programs/secpriv/).

In Spring '24, I took an [NLP](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/11-611/) course which led to work on two shared tasks in Summer '24 ([ArabicNLP '24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01360) & [CLEF '24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10252)). Building on that experience, I joined [QNRF](http://blogs.qu.edu.qa/cse/tag/qnrf/) project on Automated Essay Scoring for Arabic in collaboration with [CMUQ](https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/news/carnegie-mellon-receives-grants-for-ai-research-into-key-areas-for-qatar/) & [QU](http://qufaculty.qu.edu.qa/telsayed/current_research_projects/). 

From Summer '24, I have collaborated with the Bioinformatics team at [Sidra Medicine](https://www.sidra.org/) to build a full-stack solution - automating data extraction workflows and supporting interactive access to genomic data & [NGS](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing.html) metadata.

In Spring '25, I took a [prompt engineering](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~breaux/prompting/) course and have since been exploring generative AI â€” from research prototypes to industry implementations.

Among [other](https://abrar-abir.github.io/blog/2025/not-sponsored/) things, my intellectual curiosity includes: bio-inspired ML architectures, AI for formal verification & mechanistic interpretability for LLMs.

In my downtime, I tinker with typography (*on your left*).
