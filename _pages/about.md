... a Computer Science major at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, expecting to graduate in Fall 2025, with a concentration in Security & Privacy.

I took an NLP course in Spring 2024, which led to work on two shared tasks during Summer 2024. The results were published at conferences. Currently, I'm working on Automated Essay Scoring for Arabic.

In parallel, I work with the Genomics Data Science Core at Sidra Research as a full-stack software developer. I’m building a React + Flask + PostgreSQL-based system that automates data extraction workflows and allows researchers to interact with both metadata and genomic files.

In Spring 2025, I completed a course in prompt engineering and have since been exploring generative AI technologies — from research prototypes to practical industry use cases.

Outside of tech, I enjoy experimenting with typography.
