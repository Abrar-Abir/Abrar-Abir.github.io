	To: All current and past members of the CS community at CMUQ

	Dear all,


	The CS program on this campus has no logo of its own. Are you interested in designing one? If so, please read on!

	We are looking for a logo for our local CS program. We could use the old School of Computer Science logo from the main campus, the famous dragon:


	but we would much prefer something that represents all three elements of our identity: Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, Qatar. In search of that, we are launching a contest! If you have a good idea, please submit it. Who knows? Maybe you are destined to be the proud parent of the new SCS@CMUQ logo!

	Who can submit: Any current or past member (student, faculty, staff) of the CS community at CMUQ.

	When to submit: The deadline is March 5, 2023

	What to submit: Two mandatory items:

	A digital file containing your design - must be up to 5MB.

	A short paragraph justifying why your design makes sense - must be up to 500 words.

	What next? A committee of 2 faculty, 2 students, 2 staff, and 1 MPR member (none of whom participate in the contest) will review the submissions and select up to 3 winners. If 0 winners are selected, the new logo will be the dragon. If 2 or 3 winners are selected, then the final winner will be selected by polling the community.

	...



The logo features a bold red phoenix enclosed in a partially open circle, representing the spirit and identity of the Computer Science program at Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar (CMUQ). The phoenix, a mythical bird known for rising from its own ashes, symbolizes resilience, renewal, and continuous transformation—qualities that are deeply aligned with the nature of computer science as a discipline. It captures the innovation, adaptability, and problem-solving ethos that define the field, as well as the growth and evolution of the CS community at CMUQ.

The choice of deep red directly reflects Carnegie Mellon University’s official colors, ensuring a strong visual and symbolic connection to the institution’s identity. The stylized, dynamic form of the phoenix projects confidence and excellence, echoing the high standards and global reputation of CMU’s School of Computer Science. Encircling the bird is a sleek, incomplete ring that suggests unity, inclusiveness, and a sense of belonging—key values within the close-knit CS community at the Qatar campus.

Importantly, the design subtly incorporates local context by evoking the shape of a falcon, Qatar’s national bird, known for its strength, focus, and cultural significance. This fusion of the phoenix and falcon bridges global and regional identities, celebrating both CMU’s legacy and the unique environment of Qatar. Overall, the logo is modern, versatile, and meaningful—it encapsulates the transformative power of computing, the prestige of Carnegie Mellon, and the pride of place in Qatar, making it a fitting symbol for SCS\@CMUQ.

# Expecto Signum: Fawkes and the Flame

*On the art of visual storytelling and the delicate dance between symbol and meaning*

When the call came out for a new logo for Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science program in Qatar, I found myself staring at a fascinating design challenge—one that would require weaving together three distinct narrative threads into a single, coherent visual statement. Like any worthwhile design problem, it wasn't just about making something that looked good. It was about creating a symbol that could carry the weight of identity, aspiration, and belonging.

## The Mythology of Code

The phoenix emerged from my sketches not as a conscious decision, but as an inevitable conclusion. There's something profoundly beautiful about this mythological creature's relationship to the creative process—particularly in computer science. Every programmer knows the cycle intimately: you build something, it breaks, you rebuild it better. Code is written, debugged, refactored, and reborn. Systems crash and are reconstructed stronger than before. The phoenix doesn't just represent rebirth; it embodies the fundamental philosophy of iterative improvement that drives all technological progress.

In the sweeping curves of the bird's wings, I saw the elegance of algorithms. In its upward trajectory, the relentless pursuit of innovation. The phoenix doesn't merely survive its trials—it transforms through them, emerging with greater power and purpose. This felt like the perfect metaphor for a computer science program that prepares students to navigate an ever-evolving technological landscape.

## The Language of Color

Carnegie Mellon red was non-negotiable, but it was also a gift. Red is the color of passion, of energy, of bold decisions. It's a color that refuses to whisper when it could shout. In the context of this logo, the red becomes more than university branding—it becomes the visual embodiment of the program's intensity and ambition.

But red also carries symbolic weight across cultures. In many Eastern traditions, red represents good fortune and prosperity. In the Arab world, it can signify courage and strength. By embracing this bold chromatic choice, the logo speaks multiple cultural languages simultaneously, much like the diverse community it represents.

## The Geometry of Belonging

The circular frame that embraces the phoenix required careful consideration. Complete circles can feel constraining, like boundaries that limit possibility. So I left it open—a gesture that suggests growth, welcome, and the infinite potential for expansion. This opening also creates visual tension, a dynamic quality that keeps the eye engaged and suggests movement beyond the frame's boundaries.

The angular, geometric interpretation of the phoenix form was equally deliberate. Organic curves have their place, but technology demands precision. The sharp edges and defined planes speak to the digital realm while maintaining the creature's essential grace and power. It's a phoenix that could emerge from a graphics rendering engine—simultaneously mythological and computational.

## The Subtle Art of Cultural Fusion

Perhaps the most delicate aspect of this design lies in its quiet nod to Qatari heritage. The falcon is Qatar's national bird, a symbol deeply woven into the country's cultural fabric. Rather than creating an obvious hybrid creature, I allowed falcon-like qualities to inform the phoenix's proportions and posture. The result is a design that feels at home in Doha while remaining universally readable as a phoenix.

This kind of cultural layering requires restraint. Too obvious, and you risk creating a logo that feels forced or superficial. Too subtle, and the connection disappears entirely. The sweet spot lies in that liminal space where cultural references enhance rather than dominate the primary narrative.

## The Test of Time and Context

A successful logo must work across contexts—on business cards and billboards, in black and white and full color, on screens and in print. This phoenix was designed with scalability in mind, its bold forms remaining legible even at small sizes. The strong silhouette ensures instant recognition, while the internal details reward closer inspection.

More importantly, it needed to feel authentic to the community it represents. A computer science program isn't just about technology—it's about the people who dedicate themselves to pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The phoenix, with its associations of transformation and renewal, speaks to that human element of technological progress.

## Beyond the Brief

What began as a contest submission became an exercise in visual storytelling. The brief asked for something representing Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, and Qatar. But the real challenge was creating a symbol that could grow with the program, that could inspire current students and attract future ones, that could represent not just what the program is, but what it aspires to become.

In the end, effective logo design isn't about creating pretty pictures—it's about crystallizing identity into symbol. The phoenix rising from its circular frame doesn't just represent CMUQ's Computer Science program; it embodies the transformative power of education, the cyclical nature of innovation, and the eternal human drive to build something better from what came before.

Sometimes the best logos are the ones that surprise even their creators with how much story they can tell in a single, elegant form. This phoenix, I believe, has stories yet to tell.

# Expecto Sigilum : Conjuring Falco Ignis
*Confession of an accidental spellcast*

*A confession from someone who definitely shouldn't have tried this*

	I am not a graphic designer or illustrator of any sort. but when I received the email, I thoguht to myself, it'd be nice if I could design a logo. 
	Time passed, I almost forgot. Once I was clearing out my inbox to take a break from my coding sessions [this is one of those things like clening my  room when I have something due but I dont feel like working, so I decide to do something that is way out of my comfort zone instead - if you know]. And I was looking at that email again. I couldnt shake off the temptation to just try and see how far it goes - cause there will be voting to choose the best logo. I wanted to submit one just to see where it would stand. Again, i'm not a graphic designer/illustrator, so I dont know to use photoshop or anything. I spent a couple hours in total. brainstorming, using google image search, microsoft photos [to crop and edit images] and microsoft paint to put overlaps of cropped peices. At hte end, of course it was looking horrible, and I wanted something simple - monochromatic. So, at the end, I run a python code to color all the non-white part of the image to cmu red color - usually you'd vector trace the outline and then fill, but again i'm not an illustrator.  


Let me start with a disclaimer: I am not a graphic designer. I can barely draw a decent stick figure, and my idea of artistic software is Microsoft Paint. So when that email landed in my inbox asking for logo submissions for CMUQ's Computer Science program, my first thought was "well, that's not for me" followed immediately by filing it away in the digital equivalent of "maybe later."

Time passed. I almost forgot about it entirely.

## The Art of Productive Procrastination

You know that feeling when you have a coding assignment due and suddenly cleaning your room becomes the most urgent task in the world? That's exactly where I was when I found myself excavating my inbox during what was supposed to be a study break. There it was again—that logo contest email, staring at me like an interesting puzzle I'd left unsolved.

I couldn't shake the thought: *What if I just tried?* 

There was something irresistibly appealing about the challenge. Here was a problem with constraints—represent Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon, and Qatar in one cohesive design—and as any CS student knows, constraints make problems interesting. Plus, there would be voting. I was curious to see where a complete amateur's attempt would land in the rankings.

So I did what any reasonable person would do: I opened Microsoft Paint.

## The Tools of Necessity

My design arsenal was, shall we say, unconventional:
- Google Image Search (for "research")
- Microsoft Photos (for cropping)
- Microsoft Paint (for everything else)
- A growing sense of "what have I gotten myself into?"

I started from just browsing images, trying to understand what made logos work. Phoenix imagery kept appearing in my searches—this mythological bird that dies and comes back to life. The symbolism felt perfect for computer science. We're constantly building things, watching them fail, then rebuilding them better. Code breaks, we fix it. Systems crash, we architect them stronger. The phoenix wasn't just a pretty bird; it was basically a CS student's spirit animal.

## The Elegant Art of Digital Collage

What followed was perhaps the most amateur hour of design work ever attempted. I found phoenix silhouettes, cropped them with the precision of someone using a butter knife for surgery, and started overlaying pieces in Paint like I was solving a jigsaw puzzle. The result was... well, let's call it "rough."

But here's the thing about constraints—they force creativity. I couldn't make something complex even if I wanted to. I was limited to simple shapes, basic editing, and whatever my non-artist brain could conceptualize. So I embraced simplicity. Monochromatic design wasn't an aesthetic choice; it was survival.

The circular frame happened almost by accident. I was trying to contain the chaos of my phoenix collage, and a circle felt like the simplest boundary. Leaving it open wasn't some profound statement about growth and possibility—it was just easier to draw that way.

## When Code Becomes Your Design Tool

After a couple hours of digital arts and crafts, I had something that resembled a logo, but it looked exactly like what it was: a franken-creation of cropped images held together by Paint and determination. The colors were all wrong, the edges were rough, and it had that unmistakable "made by someone who doesn't know what they're doing" quality.

That's when I remembered something important: I might not be a designer, but I am a programmer.

Instead of learning to use proper design software (which would have taken weeks), I wrote a Python script to solve my color problem. A few lines of code to identify all non-white pixels and replace them with Carnegie Mellon red. It wasn't elegant—a real designer would vector trace the outline and fill it properly—but it worked.

```python
# Essentially: if pixel != white: pixel = cmu_red
```

Sometimes the most direct solution is the best solution, even if it's not the "right" way.

## The Unexpected Poetry of Amateur Hour

Looking at the final result, I realized I'd accidentally stumbled into something that felt authentic. The angular, slightly rough edges gave it a digital quality that seemed appropriate for a CS program. The bold red silhouette was striking in its simplicity. The phoenix, despite being cobbled together from Google image searches, somehow retained its essential power and grace.

The falcon-like qualities I mentioned in my submission? That was me trying to retroactively find meaning in happy accidents. The truth is, when you're working with limited skills and basic tools, you take what you can get and find the story afterward.

## The Real Design Lesson

What I learned from this accidental foray into logo design wasn't about color theory or composition principles. It was about the power of constraints and the courage to attempt something outside your comfort zone. Every programmer knows that the best solutions often come from working within limitations, from finding creative ways around obstacles.

My Phoenix wasn't born from design expertise—it emerged from the same problem-solving mindset that drives good code. Break down the problem, work with available tools, iterate until it works, and don't let perfect be the enemy of functional.

The fact that other people saw merit in this Microsoft Paint phoenix says something about the universality of good ideas, regardless of execution polish. Sometimes authenticity trumps technique, and sometimes the best tool for the job is whatever you have access to.

## The Vote of Confidence

When the contest results came in, I was as surprised as anyone. Here was a logo created by someone who learned design principles through trial and error, executed with consumer software and a Python script, competing against submissions from people who actually knew what they were doing.

But maybe that's the most CS thing about this whole story. In programming, elegant solutions can come from anywhere—from seasoned architects or from students trying something for the first time. The code doesn't care about your credentials; it only cares if you solve the problem.

The Phoenix logo might not have been born from traditional design expertise, but it was created with the same iterative, problem-solving spirit that defines computer science itself. And in the end, maybe that's the most fitting origin story a CS program logo could have.

*Sometimes the best way to represent your field is to embody its core principles, even when you're way out of your depth.*
