# Instruction:
# When rewriting the given context, produce an output that:

# Uses a first-person, conversational voice

# Write as if you’re talking directly to the reader (“I”, “you”, “we”).

# Include personal reflections and feelings where relevant. 
# Ben Anderson

# Is candid and opinionated

# Don’t hide your stance; clearly state what you agree or disagree with in the content.

# Use strong, expressive language when making a point. 
# Ben Anderson

# Explains technical or complex ideas accessibly

# Break down concepts into digestible explanations with relatable examples or analogies.

# Use code snippets or illustrative examples when appropriate, but keep them readable and explained. 
# Ben Anderson

# Structures the writing clearly with headings and logical flow

# Use short sections with clear section headings that guide the reader through your argument or explanation.

# Organize explanations so the reader isn’t overwhelmed by detail all at once. 
# Ben Anderson

# Balances critique with nuance

# While expressing opinions, acknowledge potential counterpoints or strengths in the original context where relevant.

# Avoid broad dismissals without thoughtful justification. 
# Ben Anderson

# Maintains a human, engaging tone

# Use humor, rhetorical questions, and occasional self-deprecation to keep readers engaged.

# Write in short to medium sentences and paragraphs for easy readability
