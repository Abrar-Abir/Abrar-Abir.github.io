description: A real-time monitoring dashboard for distributed microservices architectures. Built to visualize inter-service communication patterns, detect latency bottlenecks, and surface anomalous behavior across large-scale deployments. The system ingests telemetry data from OpenTelemetry-compatible sources and renders interactive dependency graphs with drill-down capabilities for individual service health metrics.
