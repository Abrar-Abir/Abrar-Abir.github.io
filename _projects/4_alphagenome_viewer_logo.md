title: AlphaGenome Viewer Logo
description: "Logo for my [AlphaGenome Viewer](https://github.com/Abrar-Abir/alphagenome-viewer) package — the official page had no logo, so I made one. Combined an alpha symbol with a DNA graphic, matched the official AlphaGenome color scheme, applied Google's Inter font, with a little help from Nano Banana. Trying to preserve as much of the original visual identity as possible."
