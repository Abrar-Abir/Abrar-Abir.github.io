title: GTI Hoodie
description: "Hoodie design for Course Assistants in 15-251 (Great Theoretical Ideas in Computer Science) — one of the hardest courses at CMU, and one of the most formative. The design (inspired from the design at the [official course website](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15251/) for Pittsburgh campus) tries to capture what it feels like to be inside it: a whiteboard overflowing with ideas that are individually hard and collectively overwhelming. The caption is the course's implicit promise — the material doesn't get easier, but you're not supposed to face it alone. That's what CAs are for.
