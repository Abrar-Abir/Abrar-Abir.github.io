title: Automated Paper Summarizer
description: A retrieval-augmented summarization pipeline that ingests academic papers from arXiv and generates structured summaries with key contributions, methodology breakdowns, and limitation analyses. The system uses a fine-tuned language model paired with a citation-aware chunking strategy to preserve context across multi-section documents. Summaries are stored in a searchable knowledge base with semantic similarity retrieval for cross-paper exploration.
