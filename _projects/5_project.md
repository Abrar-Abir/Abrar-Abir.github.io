title: Rhythm Visualizer
description: An audio-reactive visualization tool that transforms live music input into dynamic particle systems and geometric patterns. The visualizer performs real-time FFT analysis to decompose audio signals into frequency bands, mapping bass frequencies to large-scale motion and treble to fine-grained particle behavior. Built with p5.js and the Web Audio API, it supports MIDI controller input for live performance tweaking of color palettes, decay rates, and symmetry modes.
