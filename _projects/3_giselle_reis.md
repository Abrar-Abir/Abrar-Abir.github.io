description: "Ongoing work on fusion typography — merging 'Giselle' and 'Reis' into a single connected glyph. The nontrivial part is the asymmetric length: the 'elle' triangle still needs work for contrast, and the first 'e' isn't clean enough yet. A tribute to [Professor Giselle Reis](https://scholars.cmu.edu/5669-giselle-reis) - Sherpa of my Undergrad journey"
