description: "One of my earliest attempts at an [ambigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram) — inspired by [John Langdon](https://www.johnlangdon.net/)'s work in [Angels & Demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_%26_Demons). Had to mix uppercase and lowercase to make the 180° rotation work. Later I lost interest in ambigrams as I discovered automated ambigram generators."
