title: أبرار|Abir
description: "Draft sketch of a duoingual fusion typography — 'Abir' in Latin script and 'أبرار' (Abrar) in Arabic, visible in the same glyph. Harder than a monolingual version: the two scripts run in opposite directions, so making both readings feel natural simultaneously is an unsolved problem in this sketch."
