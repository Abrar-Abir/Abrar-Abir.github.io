title: Secure Messaging Protocol
description: An end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol designed for resource-constrained IoT devices. The protocol implements a lightweight key exchange mechanism based on elliptic curve cryptography, optimized for devices with limited memory and processing power. Extensive formal verification was performed using ProVerif to validate resistance against man-in-the-middle and replay attacks under realistic threat models.
