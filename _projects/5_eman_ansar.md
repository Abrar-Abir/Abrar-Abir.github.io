title: Eman | أنصار
description: "A dual-language ambigram — EMAN in English and أنصار (Ansar) in Arabic (after rotation & mirroring). Bold, monochrome, minimal: with a timeless look. 'Eman' reads immediately; 'أنصار' is exclusive to the attentive viewer. A tribute to [Eman Ansar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emaans5056) - learned a lot from collaboration"
