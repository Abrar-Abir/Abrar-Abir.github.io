title: Generative Terrain Engine
description: A procedural terrain generation engine that combines Perlin noise with erosion simulation to produce photorealistic landscapes. The engine supports biome-aware generation, where vegetation density, rock formations, and water flow patterns adapt to elevation and climate parameters. Rendered in real time using a custom WebGL pipeline with level-of-detail optimizations for smooth camera traversal across vast open worlds.
